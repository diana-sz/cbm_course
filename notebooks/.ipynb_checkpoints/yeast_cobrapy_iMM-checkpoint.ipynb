    "**COBRApy** is a python package for constraint-based metabolic modeling. It contains functions for running various analyses, such as FBA, pFBA, FVA, flux sampling, building and editing models...\n",

    "\n",
    "COBRApy can read various model file types. We will use **SBML** (Systems Biology Markup Language) - one of the standard formats how to store a model. The advantage of this format is that it is both human an machine readable. This is what a reaction looks like:\n",
